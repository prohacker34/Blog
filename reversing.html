    <h3>Step 1: Preparing to Reverse</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Ensure the car is at a complete stop.</li>
      <li>Press the clutch pedal fully to the floor.</li>
      <li>Shift the gear lever into <strong>Reverse (R)</strong>.</li>
      <li>Check all mirrors and blind spots before moving.</li>
      <li>Turn your head to look behind you for maximum visibility.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Step 2: Moving Backwards Safely</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Slowly release the clutch until you reach the biting point</li>
      <li>Gently press the accelerator to start moving.</li>
      <li>Keep your speed slow—reversing is not a race.</li>
      <li>Use the clutch and brake to control your movement.</li>
      <li>Continuously scan your surroundings for pedestrians, obstacles, or other vehicles.</li>
    </ul>

    </div>

    <h3>Step 3: Parking a Manual Car</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Bring the car to a complete stop.</li>
      <li>Shift into <strong>first gear</strong> (or reverse if on a downhill slope).</li>
      <li>Engage the handbrake firmly.</li>
      <li>Turn off the ignition and remove the keys.</li>
      <li>If parked on a hill, turn your wheels toward the curb to prevent rolling.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Parking in gear adds an extra layer of safety and prevents your vehicle from moving unexpectedly.</p>

    <h3>Extra Safety Tips</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Practice reversing in an empty parking lot before trying on busy roads.</li>
      <li>Always reverse slowly—accidents happen more often when drivers rush.</li>
      <li>Never rely only on mirrors; physically turn to look behind you.</li>
      <li>When parking on a slope, combine gear selection with the handbrake for maximum security.</li>
      <li>Be extra cautious in wet or icy conditions as your tires may slip.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Common Mistakes Beginners Make</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Releasing the clutch too quickly</strong> – causes stalling or sudden movement.</li>
      <li><strong>Not checking surroundings</strong> – leads to collisions with objects or pedestrians.</li>
      <li><strong>Over-revving the engine</strong> – wastes fuel and wears out the clutch faster.</li>
      <li><strong>Parking in neutral on a slope</strong> – increases the risk of the car rolling away.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Why Mastering Reversing & Parking Matters</h3>
    <p>
      In real-world driving, you will reverse and park almost every day.
      Poor technique can lead to accidents, fines, or damage to your vehicle.
      By learning these skills properly, you will gain more confidence and
      become a safer driver overall.
